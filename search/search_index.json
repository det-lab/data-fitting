Curve fitting describes the process of matching multiple data points with an equation while finding terms to describe the margins of error and unknown parameters. </p> <p>In this lesson, we're going to use curve fitting along with gamma spectroscopy data taken at the University of Colorado Denver in order to demonstrate the usefulness of the operation. The data will include 6 radioactive isotopes with known emission spectra as well as a 7th and final unknown isotope. In the process, we will learn how create a function which will be able to fit multiple Gaussian curves, and use the data from our fits to find the parameters of a final line which will help us determine the properties of our unknown isotope. We will also learn about \\(\\chi^2\\)-fits and use one to determine how well our data fits the solution we find for the unknown isotope.</p> <p>Let's get started - click here to continue on to the next section where we will begin setting up our computers.</p>"},{"location":"02_setup/","title":"Setup","text":"<p>This lesson will be using Python 3 along with one of its more common scientific libraries: <code>scipy</code>. This lesson will be using a Jupyter Notebook. First, it'll be necessary to install python if you don't already have it. You can follow the instructions from python's official website to get started. </p> <p>It's recommended to install Jupyter Notebook through <code>pip</code>, so after installing Python you should check that it comes with <code>pip</code> installed. This can be done by running the following commands depending on your operating system:</p> Linux MacOS Windows Command (Check python) python --version python --version py --version Output Python 3.N.N Python 3.N.N Python 3.N.N Command (Check pip) python -m pip --version python -m pip --version py -m pip --version Output pip X.Y.Z from (python 3.N.N) pip X.Y.Z from (python 3.N.N) pip X.Y.Z from (python 3.N.N) <p>You can then use <code>pip</code> to install either <code>JupyterLab</code> or <code>Jupyter Notebook</code> with the command:</p> <pre><code>pip install jupyterlab\n</code></pre> <p>or:</p> <pre><code>pip install notebook\n</code></pre> <p>You can then run them with either:</p> <pre><code>jupyter lab\n</code></pre> <p>or:</p> <pre><code>jupyter notebook\n</code></pre> <p>It should be noted that in order for Jupyter to work you will also be required to have an up-to-date browser. Chrome, Safari, and Firefox are all supported.</p> <p>Running one of these commands will then open Jupyter in a browser. </p> <p>Jupyter will then show you an in-browser version of your file-explorer where you can navigate to create a new project folder to follow along with this lesson. First, make sure that you also have the necessary libraries installed as well. Click on <code>New</code> and select <code>Terminal</code> in order to ensure that the libraries are installed. From this terminal, run the commands:</p> <pre><code>pip install scipy\npip install pandas\npip install matplotlib\npip install numpy\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>pandas</code> library will be used for loading the <code>.csv</code> data, the <code>matplotlib</code> library will be used to plot the data, and <code>numpy</code> will be used for multiple mathematical expressions. </p> <p>Next, create a folder to house your project files, named something like \"data-fitting\". After doing this, download and unzip these raw data files. Then, you can move the \"raw-data\" folder into your project folder. </p> <p>Finally, create a new notebook by clicking on <code>New</code> and <code>Notebook</code> and selecting the kernel - <code>Python 3 (ipykernel)</code>. You can then either name your project or keep it untitled.</p> <p>Now that we're all setup, click here to continue to the next section where we can begin to learn more about the experiment and how it functions before getting started fitting our data.</p>"},{"location":"03_experiment_details/","title":"The Experiment","text":"<p>As mentioned previously, the data collected comes from a UCDenver gamma spectroscopy lab. The lab involved taking data using a spectrometer which is fed from first a scintillator and a photomultiplier tube (PMT) to record the energy levels emitted by various radioactive sources. Let's go over the process of gamma decay as well as describe what the related instruments are so that you can understand better the data that we're looking at when we start plotting it.</p>"},{"location":"03_experiment_details/#gamma-decay","title":"Gamma Decay","text":"<p>There are three main types of radioactive decay associated with emissions, alpha (\\(\\alpha\\)), beta (\\(\\beta\\)), and gamma (\\(\\gamma\\)), named in increasing order of their matter-penetrating abilities. These three types of emissions are noteable also for their ability to be differentiated inside of an electromagnetic field. Radioactive decay can be observed in all isotopes of all elements of equal or greater atomic mass than bismuth.</p> <ol> <li>Alpha (\\(\\alpha\\)) Decay</li> </ol> <p>This type of decay results in a postively charged alpha particle, consisting of two protons and two neutrons (a helium nucleus) being ejected from the nucleus of a heavier element (usually). This type of radiation is the least penetrating, stopped by centimeters of air, but is also the most destructive form of ionizing radiation. Because of their low penetrating power however, they are generally only harmful to life if the radioactive source is swallowed or inhaled.</p> <ol> <li>Beta (\\(\\beta\\)) Decay</li> </ol> <p>This type of decay results in a negatively charged beta particle, which can be a high-speed electron (\\(\\beta^-\\) decay), or its antimatter counterpart the positron (\\(\\beta^+\\) decay). This type of radiation is inbetween the other two in terms of both ionization and penetrative power.</p> <ol> <li>Gamma (\\(\\gamma\\)) Decay </li> </ol> <p>Unlike the other two, gamma decay doesn't release a particle with mass, it instead releases electromagnetic radiation in the form of a photon, which has no charge. It differs from other forms of electromagnetic radiation that you may be familiar with (such as visible light or x-rays) only in that they have the shortest wavelengths and thus the highest energies of light. Gamma radiation has many possible sources, but in particle physics it normally occurs after a nucleus undergoes one of the other two types of decay. This decay leaves the nucleus in an excited state, and when the nucleons (nuclear particles) transition to a lower resting state they release one of these high energy photons. </p> <p>This transition is much like the process through which the more common types of light are emitted, where an electron will transition between energy levels and release a photon in the process. However, this transition operates using the strong nuclear force, producing a photon orders of magnitude more energetic than otherwise. The typical photon released through electric relaxation will be in the eV range, usually less than 100eV, while the typical photon released from an atomic nucleus will range from around 1KeV to 10MeV of energy.</p> <p>Gamma radiation has the most ability to penetrate materials but is also the least ionizing of these three types of radiation.</p>"},{"location":"03_experiment_details/#instrumentation","title":"Instrumentation","text":"<p>Now that we've gone over the different types of radiation, let's go over how we can detect them experimentally, and then how we can use these detections to calibrate our instruments and determine the properties of an unknown isotope.</p>"},{"location":"03_experiment_details/#scintillator","title":"Scintillator","text":"<p>The scintillator is the first step in our instrumentation. These devices utilize the properties of certain materials to luminesce when excited by radiation, causing them to re-emit light at a lower and more easily detectable wavelength. For gamma ray detection, photons Compton scatter off of electrons in the structure of the scintillator. </p> <p>Compton scattering describes the effect where high-energy photons interact with loosely-bound valence shell electrons, giving them enough energy to be released from their atoms, ionizing the atom in the process. Those free electrons then scatter off of other electrons, spreading the energy of the inital gamma ray across multiple electrons. As each of these electrons relax and are recaptured by the ionized atoms, they then release photons at a lower energy.</p> <p>It is by this process that one high energy gamma ray can be turned into several lower energy photons which can then be detected using the second instrument in the experiment.</p>"},{"location":"03_experiment_details/#photomultiplier-tube-pmt","title":"Photomultiplier Tube (PMT)","text":"<p>A PMT is an incredibly sensitive photon detector, and they are normally designed to detect light specifically in the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum (which is why we need the scintillator to step-down our photon energies).</p> <p>They are typically constructed using an evacuated glass housing with a photocathode on one end which is engineered to use the photoelectric effect. This again uses light to release electrons, but now in the presence of an electric field. The electric field then accelerates the released electrons towards the back of the PMT, and along the way the electrons will strike against arrays of dynodes.</p> <p>Each dynode has a higher potential difference (voltage) than the previous one, and they are designed so that with each electron that strikes them they release several more. This causes an exponential cascade of electrons to course through the system until they finally reach the anode at the end of the PMT. Here, the cascade of electrons results in a current which can be detected using a device such as an oscilloscope, or a spectrometer in the case of this experiment, and the results can then be recorded.</p>"},{"location":"03_experiment_details/#spectrometer","title":"Spectrometer","text":"<p>\"Spectrometer\" is a fairly broad class of instruments used for detecting and measuring the spectal components of light. The one used for this experiment was a Universal Computer Spectrometer (UCS). The UCS is the final component in the detection chain and serves as the interface between the analog signal produced by the PMT and the digital data we will analyze. This type of spectrometer is called \"universal\" as it can be configured for a wide range of radiation detection experiments, and \"computer\" as it can be integrated with a digital system capable of binning, processing, and storing pulse data. </p> <p>It works by monitoring the voltage pulses generated at the anode of the PMT. Each pulse corresponds to a single photon event detected by the scintillator and converted to a current by the PMT. The one used in this experiment contained 2048 channels, with the higher channels corresponding to higher detected currents.</p>"},{"location":"03_experiment_details/#data-analysis","title":"Data Analysis","text":"<p>The next step in this process is to take the data from the radioactive sources and feed them into a computer using software. As decay events occur in relation to the the associated element's half life, it is necessary to run the detection software for several minutes for each element in order to collect as much data as possible. </p> <p>After an event is measured by a specific channel, that channel's count number is increased by one. This eventually results in noticeable peaks which correspond with the given isotope's emission energy. </p> <p>However, due to the steps of the scintillator and PMT, it is not possible to immediately directly correlate a specific channel with a specific energy. It is because of the steps required to be able to detect the gamma rays in the first place that we must also perform significant data analysis to associate channel numbers with emission energies. The resulting relationship between channel numbers and emission energies is linear. Each channel should correspond to a specific range of gamma energies.</p> <p>This is then limited by the fact that the gamma events aren't being fed directly into the scintillator and PMT. They are placed underneath the detector setup and then allowed to radiate spherically. Some of these emissions will hit the detectors with a glancing blow, meaning that they'll have less detected energy than the others, while a small amount of particles actually will be sent straight up the detector, resulting in a higher detected energy than average. This distribution of energies will result in a Gaussian curve, where the center of the curve will correspond to the average detected energies of the emitted particles, but with a margin of error.</p> <p>So, in order to determine what element our unknown radioactive source is, it will be necessary to first perform a curve fit for each one of the peaks detected, and then use the known values for their emissions to perform a second curve fit to relate the channel numbers with their actual energies. </p> <p>Let's get going, then! Click here to continue to the next section where we'll learn how to use the <code>scipy</code> library to perform these curve fits.</p>"}]}
