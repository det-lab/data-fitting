# Introduction
Curve fitting is one of the most powerful tools available to us in modern computing. Curve fitting describes the process of matching multiple data points with an equation while finding terms to describe the margins of error and unknown parameters. 

In this lesson, we're going to use curve fitting along with gamma spectroscopy data taken at the University of Colorado Denver in order to demonstrate the usefulness of the operation. The data will include 6 radioactive isotopes with known emission spectra as well as a 7th and final unknown isotope. In the process, we will learn how create a function which will be able to fit multiple Gaussian curves, and use the data from our fits to find the parameters of a final line which will help us determine the properties of our unknown isotope. We will also learn about $\chi^2$-fits and use one to determine how well our data fits the solution we find for the unknown isotope.
